# No Hats Mod
This is a mod for Team Fortress 2 that removes just about all of the cosmetics from the game to remove visual clutter
and to give a bit more of an FPS boost for machines that desperately want to get more FPS.

# How to install:
1. Download the mod from GitHub. It should be downloaded as a .zip file.

2. Open the .zip file. Inside should be a folder labelled "No-Hats-Mod-master". Open that folder.

3. Extract the .vpk file to steam > steamapps > common > Team Fortress 2 > tf > custom

You should now be able to boot into your game and have the No Hats mod loaded.
